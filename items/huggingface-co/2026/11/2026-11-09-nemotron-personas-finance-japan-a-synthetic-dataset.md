*A compound AI approach to Japanese personas grounded in real-world distributions*

### Open Data Breaking Down Privacy Barriers to Pave the Way for AI in Finance

In the financial sector, the utilization of real-world data faces significant constraints due to strict privacy regulations, compliance requirements, and the need for advanced domain expertise. In this context, the development of agentic AI in the financial domain requires synthetic data capable of avoiding the risks of using real data while reflecting demographics, household structures, and asset statuses to reproduce diverse, realistic financial scenarios.

To address these challenges, [Elith](https://www.elith.ai/) and NVIDIA have released [**Nemotron-Personas-Finance-Japan**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Personas-Finance-Japan), a financial domain extension of the open-source persona dataset "[Nemotron-Personas-Japan](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Personas-Japan)." To our knowledge, it is the first open persona dataset at million-record scale that pairs Japan’s official statistics with household finance and financial literacy data. Built upon official government statistics, this dataset was developed using [NeMo SDG-PGMs](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/SDG-PGMs), a probabilistic graphical model framework for synthetic data generation (SDG), and [NeMo Data Designer](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/DataDesigner), an enterprise synthetic data generation system. Furthermore, to enhance the practical utility of the dataset in financial use cases, it was designed by incorporating insights and feedback provided by leading domestic financial institutions and industry associations, including Sompo Japan, Tokio Marine Holdings, Bank of Fukuoka, Mizuho Financial Group, Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance, and the Financial Data Utilization Association (FDUA).

This dataset expands the environment where Japanese developers and enterprises can develop and evaluate AI tailored to local and industry requirements, without using real customer data. Released under the **CC BY 4.0** license, it is available for commercial use. **From building conversational agents to customer simulation and model evaluation, it supports practical financial AI development**. The [Nemotron-Personas collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-personas), including Nemotron-Personas-Finance-Japan, is designed to seamlessly integrate with the user simulation framework [NeMo User Sim](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/UserSim), enabling instant execution of simulations drawn from diverse distributions consistent with the real world.

### What’s in the Dataset?

- **9M personas total** (1M records x 9 personas each), written in natural Japanese
- **50 fields per record**: 9 persona fields, 11 persona attributes, and 30 contextual fields based on official demographic and labor statistics
- **\~1.5B tokens total**, including ~750M persona tokens
- **\~950k unique names**
- **1600+ occupation categories** reflecting Japan's workforce
- **Comprehensive coverage** across demographic, regional, asset distribution, and personality trait axes
- **Diverse persona types**: Occupations, sports, arts, travel, cooking, finance, financial behavior, and financial concerns
- **Natural language persona attributes**: Cultural background, skills and expertise, career goals and aspirations, hobbies and interests, household/parental/financial background, attitudes toward money, and financial planning
- **Available for both commercial and non-commercial use** under the CC BY 4.0 license

### **How We Built It**

#### **Data Generation Pipeline**

It was built using NVIDIA’s framework for synthetic data generation, **NeMo Data Designer**. This compound AI system enables complex Jinja templating, Pydantic validation, structured outputs, automated retries, and support for multiple generation backends. This is the essential toolset required for generating such large-scale synthetic datasets. In addition, the following models were utilized:

- **NeMo SDG-PGMs (Apache-2.0)**: A probabilistic graphical model framework for statistically grounded data generation
- **gemma-4-31B-it (Apache-2.0)**: For Japanese text generation

#### **Enhanced Cultural Context**

Nemotron-Personas-Finance-Japan was designed to align with Japan's official demographic and labor statistics while taking into account key considerations essential for AI training:

- **Education**: Where national statistics broadly aggregate degree levels, we introduced finer granularity to enable the model to reflect diverse educational pathways.
- **Occupation**: We incorporated additional categories (such as business owners and specialized professions) to broaden the spectrum of occupations used for training.
- **Life Stages**: We modeled scenarios that rarely surface prominently in statistics, such as students, retirees, and periods of unemployment, to represent more realistic personas.
- **Household Finances**: In addition to individual income and spending propensity, we incorporated household-level financial and real assets to replicate diverse economic backgrounds.
- **Digital & Financial Literacy**: By including internet and smartphone usage along with financial literacy, we enabled the model to precisely capture consumer profiles in financial use cases.

### **Private By Design**

Every persona is fully synthetic. No real individuals are represented, and the dataset is designed to reduce privacy risk. Demographics and household finances follow official statistics and public survey data, and names follow real Japanese naming patterns. Personas are built from these distributions, not from records about real people.

### **Who This Data Is For**

Nemotron-Personas-Finance-Japan is built first for teams creating financial AI in Japan, at banks and insurers and at the startups and integrators that serve them. Each persona carries household finances and financial literacy alongside demographics. Teams can use them to build customer-service agents, evaluate sales conversations/marketing initiatives, run user simulations in NeMo User Sim, and red-team customer-facing AI.

The release also serves anyone building for Japanese users. It holds 9M personas, 50% more than Nemotron-Personas-Japan, across 50 fields instead of 22. That gives any Japanese-language project finer slices of the population to train and test on.

### **Practical AI Applications**

The synthetic personas in this dataset can be leveraged for:

- **Multi-turn conversation**: Using personas as "seeds" to generate human-like dialogue datasets.
- **Domain-specific AI development**: Generating datasets to build AI assistants tailored to realistic scenarios in financial use cases.
- **Bias testing and fairness**: Evaluating how models and AI agent systems perform across rural and urban divides, various age groups, educational backgrounds, and economic circumstances to check whether AI performs consistently across Japanese society.

### **Why It Matters**

Access to diverse, high-quality training data that reflects real-world populations has long been a challenge in AI development. Enterprise AI development has predominantly relied on private data, creating barriers for researchers, startups, and particularly AI developers in regions with limited available data.

- **Data Diversity**: Reflects the full spectrum of Japan's population, which helps reduce biased training and the risk of [model collapse](https://medium.com/data-science/addressing-concerns-of-model-collapse-from-synthetic-data-in-ai-7cd380208d14).
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Reduces reliance on Western-centric datasets and supports the development of [Sovereign AI systems](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/lp/industries/global-public-sector/sovereign-ai-technical-overview/).
- **Privacy and Governance**: Aligned with Japan’s innovation-first approach to AI governance. Every persona is synthetic, so no customer data is needed to build or test with it.

By releasing Nemotron-Personas-Finance-Japan under CC BY 4.0, we provide access to enterprise-grade, high-quality synthetic data, empowering anyone to build culturally grounded AI systems with lower cost and less privacy risk.

### **Pairs with Nemotron-PII-Japan**
